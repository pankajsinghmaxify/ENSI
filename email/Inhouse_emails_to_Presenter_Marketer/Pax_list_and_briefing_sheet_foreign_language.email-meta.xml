Hi  {!Job__c.Facilitator_names__c}

Attached is the current pax list and briefing sheet for the {!Job__c.Account_Name__c} workshop scheduled for {!Job__c.Certificate_Date_Text__c}.

This may change as we lead up to the workshop but I wanted you to have the initial list.

If you require any specific case studies, please let me know by DATE. Please note that only Crocodile Eggs and Munal Harbourside have been translated in {!Job__c.Language__c}, any other case studies required will be provided in English.

Cheers</textOnly>
