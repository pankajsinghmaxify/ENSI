Hi {!Job__c.Facilitator_names__c}<br>
<br>
Hope the workshop went well.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Just a couple of things to tidy up.<br>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Were there any changes to the participants?</strong> &nbsp;Attached is the pax list as I last had it</li>
	<li><strong>Do you want me to send a reminder to participants re their 2nd 2 days?</strong> If yes, is there anything in particular you want me to say to them? &nbsp;What time do you want them to start?</li>
	<li><strong>Please send me your invoice when ready</strong> – your fees for this workshop are:<br>
	Presenter PROF_FEE x XX% = $XXX<br>
	Marketing x XX% = $XXX<br>
	Materials commission MAT_FEE x XX% = $XXX<br>
	Plus GST<br>
	Plus Expenses (please list if they’re GST inclusive or exclusive). Remember to include your receipts<br>
	If we’re paying you in a different currency then above, please advise exchange rate used on invoice
	<li><strong>Peer/Self review</strong>&nbsp; - please complete the attached ENSI Peer/Self Review form and return to me. (Solo facilitators will complete a self-assessment and dual facilitators will peer review each other)</li>
</ul>

Thanks</span></span>
