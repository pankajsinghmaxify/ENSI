The ENSI Program is not only about giving you the skills required to approach negotiations confidently but to also ensure that your learnings are sustained and become a force of habit. We believe that engaging you before and after the workshop will increase your learning outcomes and ask that you participate fully in the activities outlined below.

We like to promote an informal atmosphere during the workshop and casual dress is welcome. Lunch will be provided and there will be suitable breaks during the program to enable participants to communicate with business colleagues and clients.

If you require accommodation, please let me know and we can recommend some hotels close to the venue. Also, please advise me within 7 days if you have any special dietary requirements

Pre-Program Requirements

No prior reading material is necessary. A comprehensive workbook will be made available at the beginning of the workshop.

Program Focus Questionnaire &apos;PFQ&apos;- the PFQ helps the program leader to customise the program based on your needs. We ask that all PFQs are completed by {!Job__c.PFQ_Due_Date__c}. Click here* to access the questionnaire.

Please come briefed with notes on at least one current negotiation situation (for use in diagnosis and review sessions during the workshop).
