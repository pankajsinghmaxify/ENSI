Hi {!Job__c.Facilitator_1__c}

I can now confirm that the {!Job__c.Venue_City__c}, Module XX Open Course on {!Job__c.Certificate_Date_Text__c} is going ahead.  The program will take place at {!Job__c.Venue_Name__c}, located at {!Job__c.Venue_Address__c}. If you need early access, please let me know so that I can arrange it with the venue.

Iâ€™ll be forwarding the participant list shortly.

The PFQ has been sent to the pax (due on {!Job__c.PFQ_Due_Date__c}), and you will receive the presenter information on DATE.

Kind regards</textOnly>
