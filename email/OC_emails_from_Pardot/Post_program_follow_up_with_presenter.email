Hi {!Job__c.Facilitator_1__c}<br>
<br>

I trust the workshop went well! I just have a few things to tidy up.  
<br><br>
Were there any changes to the participants? I have attached the participant list as I currently have it.
<br><br>
Reinforcement emails â€“ I have attached the standard reinforcement emails that we use for open courses. If you have any photos that you would like to include, send them on and please name each photo as per the email you would like it attached to. I will schedule them to be sent fortnightly.
<br><br>
Peer/Self review  - please complete the attached ENS Peer/Self Review form and return to me. (Solo facilitators will complete a self-assessment and dual facilitators will peer review each other)
<br><br>
Please send me your invoice when ready. The total is $FEE, broken down as follows
Presenter fee = $FEE
Marketer fee = $FEE
<br><br>
If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to contact me.


<br>
<br>
Kind regards</span></span>
