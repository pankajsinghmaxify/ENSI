    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

&apos;Get to where you want to be&apos;

I trust that you enjoyed yourself at the recent ENSI program and have acquired valuable skills.

With all skills it is important that we continue to reflect and practice regularly. ENSI programs are not only about giving you the skills required to approach negotiations confidently but to also ensure that your learnings are sustained and become a force of habit.

To assist this, we have given you {!Contact.Job_eLearning_Access_Period__c} access to the

ENSI 2-3 minute reinforcement eBites on Needs, Style, Climate, Tactics, Phases https://www.negotiate.org/ensi-reinforcement-ebites
Password ENSI

ENSI 30 minute interactive reinforcement module 
http://www.negotiate.org/ens-reinforcement-login 
Your username and password is {!Contact.Email}

*** Please note your password is case sensitive. We recommend you copy and paste the email above and paste into the username and password fields on the login screen ***

You will have unlimited access until {!Contact.Job_eLearning_Expiry_Date__c} and we encourage you to make use of this resource.

The module is not read only and in some instances you are required to interact/participate before you can move onto the next component.

You will need to have Flash enabled for your web browser and your volume turned on before you begin.

Should you have any questions, please don&apos;t hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards,
