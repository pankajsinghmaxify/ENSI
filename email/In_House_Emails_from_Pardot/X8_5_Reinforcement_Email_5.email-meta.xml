{!Job__c.Account_Name__c} ENSI Reinforcement Email #5


Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Check: How are you going with your PERSONAL ACTION PLANS? (Refer to your ENSI workshop text).

Two questions:

How can you better control the negotiation CLIMATE (Time / Place / Mood)?
Who has the PROCESS power – Identifying TACTICS?

Keep asking yourself: What Tactic is the OP using to influence me? Simply naming the tactic will significantly reduce its power.

Towards more successfully negotiated OUTCOMES...

Best regards

Special note: Hey you – Stay PROCESS Aware!
