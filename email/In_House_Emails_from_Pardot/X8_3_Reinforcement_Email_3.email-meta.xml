{!Job__c.Account_Name__c} ENSI Reinforcement Email #3

Greetings {!Contact.FirstName}

Three questions today:

How consciously are you applying ENSI concepts at work AND in your personal life?
How focused are you on the PROCESS – or are you too fixated on the Content?
What are the ENSI 3 Pillars which are the foundation of all effective negotiation?

Please continue working with your mentoring partner.
Check with them every second day to see how they are going.

Help each other to BE ASPIRATIONAL!
And, like all skilful negotiators, continue to **MEMO

Creating greater negotiation success…
