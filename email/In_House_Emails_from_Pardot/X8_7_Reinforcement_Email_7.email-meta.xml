{!Job__c.Account_Name__c} ENSI Reinforcement Email #7

Greetings, {!Contact.FirstName}, the great negotiator

Two questions:

What is SYSTEMATIC PREPARATION all about? (Check your ENSI workshop text)
Always remember – after every negotiation undertake a PROCESS REVIEW (Three Did Wells and three Do Differently&apos;s)

AND three final tips:

Continually separate the ‘Content’ from the ‘Process’
– Stay PROCESS AWARE!

Always remember the ENSI ‘SECRET’ STRATEGY
– They [OP] choose my preferred OPTION!

Continue to first seek out and build the ‘BLUE’ COMMON GROUND.

This will be our last formal follow-up reinforcement email.

Good luck and best wishes for achieving superior negotiation outcomes.
