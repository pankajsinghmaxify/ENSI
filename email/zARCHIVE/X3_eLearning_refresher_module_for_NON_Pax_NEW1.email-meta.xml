    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

You have been selected to receive {!Contact.Job_eLearning_Access_Period__c} access to the ENS International Negotiation and Influencing eLearning module.

The module will challenge you to observe an internal negotiation in progress and to strategise a way forward from a deadlock. You will have two strategic options to review; to recover the difficult situation, and to prepare systematically, in order to avoid such a situation entirely.

Access our online module at http://www.negotiate.org/ens-reinforcement-login

Your username and password is {!Contact.Email}

*** Please note your password is case sensitive. We recommend you copy and paste the email above and paste into the username and password fields on the login screen ***

You will have unlimited access until {!Contact.Job_eLearning_Expiry_Date__c} and we encourage you to make use of this resource.

The module is not read only and in some instances you are required to interact/participate before you can move onto the next component.

You will need to have Flash enabled for your web browser and your volume turned on before you begin.

Should you have any questions, please don&apos;t hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards
