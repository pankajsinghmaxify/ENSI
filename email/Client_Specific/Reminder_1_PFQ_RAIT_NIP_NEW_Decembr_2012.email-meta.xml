Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Please remember to complete your two ENS Pre-Program Questionnaires by {!Contact.Job_PFQ_Due_Date__c}.

The 2 pre-program questionnaires are:

Program Focus Questionnaire &apos;PFQ&apos;- the PFQ helps the Lead Facilitator to customise the workshop based on your needs. We ask that all PFQs are completed by {!Contact.Job_PFQ_Due_Date__c}.
Click here to access the questionnaire.*Please note that this link is specific to you, please don&apos;t forward it to others.
Negotiating and Influencing Profile ‘NIP’ - the NIP covers 20 key competencies relating to the negotiation and influencing capabilities of individuals. You will receive a separate email with instructions to logon and complete the NIP online. This should take approximately 20 minutes. We ask that all NIPs are completed by {!Contact.Job_NIP_Due_Date__c}.

NB: If you have already started your questionnaire and have opted to &apos;save and continue&apos; while in the questionnaire - it is important that you use the link that was sent to you at the time you saved your response, otherwise the above link will open a new questionnaire.

We look forward to seeing you at the workshop, a key part of Takeda&apos;s M4NTRA Program!

Kind regards,

{!Contact.Job_CSM_Name__c}
