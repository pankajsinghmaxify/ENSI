    <subject>ENSI Case Study Request - Share Your {!Contact.Job_Account_Name__c} I+N Experiences</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}

No doubt you have been applying your {!Contact.Program_Name__c} skills successfully to {!Contact.Job_Account_Name__c} cases since your ENS workshop on {!Contact.Job_Certificate_Date__c}.

As part of your program, now is the time when we ask you to share one short example on how you have applied the ENS model in a real-life negotiation situation, preferably your &apos;Must Win, Can&apos;t Fail&apos;. The online survey should take no more than 5-10 minutes to complete and can be accessed here. 
http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1725351/ENS-Four-Week-Must-Win-Can-t-Fail-Application-Survey?jid={!Contact.Last_Job_ID__c}&amp;pid={!Contact.Last_Participant_Id__c}
This link is specific to you, please don&apos;t forward to others.

It would be appreciated if you could complete your response by:  {!Contact.Job_6_week_case_study_due__c}.

Your ENS facilitator/s {!Contact.Job_Presenters__c}, will review all responses and a report with their feedback will be provided to the group along with everyone&apos;s (anonymous) examples.  Click here to see a sample report.

We encourage you to invest your time in this just as your company has invested in your development and they will be following up for responses as required.

We look forward to hearing about your &apos;Must Win, Can&apos;t Fail&apos; experiences and to providing you with some more feedback.

Kind regards
