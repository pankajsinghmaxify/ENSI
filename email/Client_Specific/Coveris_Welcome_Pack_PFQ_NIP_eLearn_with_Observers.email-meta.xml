The ENS Program is not only about giving you the skills required to approach negotiations confidently but to also ensure that your learnings are sustained and become a force of habit. We believe that engaging you before and after the workshop will increase your learning outcomes and ask that you participate fully in the activities outlined below. Results of the post program case study and survey are returned to your management to assist them in understanding your challenges and successes.
