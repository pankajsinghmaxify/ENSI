    <textOnly>Hi {!Job__c.NAM_Name__c}

I trust this finds you well.

After the sessions with {!Job__c.Facilitator_names__c} this week, there are XXX hours remaining on your retainer.

Given the on-going work with {!Job__c.Facilitator_names__c}, would you like to roll the retainer over into another 35 hr block?

Please let me know.

Kind regards</textOnly>
