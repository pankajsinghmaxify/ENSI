    <textOnly>Hi {!Job__c.NAM_Name__c}

I trust all is well and that you enjoyed seeing how your group has been using their skills from the {!Job__c.Certificate_Date_Text__c} ENSI workshop in our Application report that was forwarded earlier.

Today I issued an invitation to the same group to complete ENSI’s 3 month post-program ‘Impact and Value’ Survey which asks them to provide their impressions on what impact and value they have seen from the workshop. We have given them until {!Job__c.X3_month_case_study_due__c} to complete the survey. Let me know if you’d like to alter this timeline as I’d be happy to work with what fits your group best.

On completion, we will produce a report to show:

perceived performance improvement
key concepts remembered
overall benefit of course
noticed areas of improvement
broad estimate of the total financial benefit achieved over the last three months as a result of the workshop

An example of the impact and value report is attached. I’ve also included a copy of the invitation sent to participants for your reference.

We will be back in contact post the survey due date if we haven’t received sufficient responses.

Kind regards</textOnly>
