Dear&nbsp;{!Job__c.NAM_Name__c}<br>
<br>
We’re excited to be working with&nbsp;{!Job__c.Account_Name__c} and the participants on the upcoming workshop.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In order for the participants to complete the pre-program requirements, could you please forward me a list with each participants full name and email address within the next week for your&nbsp;{!Job__c.Certificate_Date_Text__c} workshop. I have attached a template for your participant details if you’d like to use this. As per our letter of engagement, we are able to accept up to <strong><span style="color:#EE0090;">XXX</span></strong> participants for this workshop.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
If you intend to take up the option for additional participants please let us know by <strong><span style="color:#EE0090;">DATE</span></strong>, to prevent the cost of another freight charge for the extra materials.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I would appreciate if you could also advise the venue address and contact details for someone to receive the program materials. I will be sending the materials to arrive on <strong><span style="color:#EE0090;">DAY_DATE</span></strong>. Please refer to the attached Venue Administration Checklist for our venue requirements.<br>
<br>
Kind regards</span></span>
