    <textOnly>Dear {!Job__c.NAM_Name__c}

We’re excited to be working with {!Job__c.Account_Name__c} and the participants on the upcoming workshop.

In order for the participants to complete the pre-program requirements, could you please forward me a list with each participants full name and email address within the next week for your {!Job__c.Certificate_Date_Text__c} workshop. I have attached a template for your participant details if you’d like to use this.  As per our letter of engagement, we are able to accept up to XXX participants for this workshop.

If you intend to take up the option for additional participants please let us know by DATE, to prevent the cost of another freight charge for the extra materials.

I would appreciate if you could also advise the venue address and contact details for someone to receive the program materials. I will be sending the materials to arrive on DAY_DATE. Please refer to the attached Venue Administration Checklist for our venue requirements.

Kind regards</textOnly>
